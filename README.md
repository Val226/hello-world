This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow
My name is Val, I am aspiring to be a software developer! I am loving learning code (some days it's really frustrating, but such is life!)! In my free time, I love watching thriller, mystery and crime shows and movies. I also enjoy video games, camping and reading a good book with a nice cup of tea.
